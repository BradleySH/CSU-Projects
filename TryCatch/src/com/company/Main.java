    //Write program with a method that returns an array.
// The method should accept as input a comma-delimited string with three values from a user.
// The array should store each value in a different element.
// Use Try..Catch error handling and print any failure messages,
// or print success from within method if execution is successful (see Chapter 6 in the text).
// Call the method from the main method of the program to demonstrate its functionality by looping through the array and printing the individual values.
